# Creating the easiest 3D design tool

Vectary 3.0 is an online 3D design tool that aims to empower 3D workflows in online and AR world. The interface is easy enough to have a first project done in less than 15 minutes, even for an absolute 3D beginner. The product brings heavy features such as embeddable viewer, organized CMS for 3D files, or collaboration. Everything is stored in the cloud, so you don't have to bother with project files or manual saving.

# My Role

In a span of 6 months, I co-led the redesign and implementation of the engine 3.0 with our Head of Product Milan Gladis. Besides managing the product release, I helped to define and maintain Vectary's design system and designed the interface of the engine's modes. Design responsibilities included **research, information architecture, user flows, interaction, visual, prototyping,** alongside **dev tasking and mentoring of new colleagues**.

# Background

In 2014, Vectary started its long-term commitment of bringing 3D to the masses. With a steep learning curve and a growing community platform, we were able to successfully cover our role and continue to expand with new releases. Vectary 2.0 introduced a new design of the engine and key features, such as the object mode, texturing, or rendering. The upcoming months after the release were essential in defining the trajectory towards our initial goal.

# Challenge

**High level goals:**1. Prepare the engine for the growth\
2. Determine where the product features should be heading\
3. Create proper guidance for the user

With 2.0, we divided the engine's functionality into multiple modes under which we hid all the tools. The toolset still contained just a portion of what Vectary could reach. At the time, we had an already existing user flows - new implementations in 3D are often hard on resources, so the right decision making in the future progress was crucial. Our ambition was to create a strong base for the complexity which was Vectary already reaching.

# Solution

Vectary 3.0 brings the full suite for designing, managing and sharing the 3D content through AR and online media. With its approachable design, anyone can pick up the 3D content creation easily and include it in their workflow.

Together with separating space for the modes and tools, and proper maintenance of our own design system, the flow between each of the parts of the product can be kept intuitive and accessible.

## Unified Design System

The user can use a helping hand through the interactive onboarding, during his first steps in the engine. Through the guide, he can be comfortably introduced to the basics of our functionality.

## Interactive Onboarding

Introducing 17 new tools, the workflow is significantly sped up during the modelling and assembling process. All thanks to the smart deformers and generators, which can be stacked and combined with each other.
